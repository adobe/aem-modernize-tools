### Page Rewrite Rule

The Page Rewrite Rule has been updated to support restricting paths to which a given configuration can apply. This was added based on feedback from users where original pages for different tenants used the same Static Template, but the desired Editable Template was unique to the tenant. 

Without this update, each tenant's configuration would need to be installed, run, then removed for the next tenant configuration could be applied. Instead, now a path restriction is used to determine if a rule applies. 

Thus the new configuration supports the following:

``` properties
allowed.paths=["/content/geometrixx/en", "/content/geometrixx/de"]
static.template="/apps/geometrixx/templates/homepage"
sling.resourceType="geometrixx/components/homepage"
editable.template="/conf/geodemo/settings/wcm/templates/geodemo-home-page"
container.resourceType="geodemo/components/content/container"
remove.components=["newslist","image"]
rename.components=["par\=container/container","rightpar\=container_1659979946"]
order.components=["header","carousel","container","container_1659979946","container:lead"]
```
