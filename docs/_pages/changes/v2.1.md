### Page Rewrite Rule

The Page Rewrite Rule has been updated to support restricting paths to which a given configuration can apply. This was added based on feedback from users where original pages for different tenants used the same Static Template, but the desired Editable Template was unique to the tenant. 

Without this update, each tenant's configuration would need to be installed, run, then removed for the next tenant configuration could be applied. Instead, now a path restriction is used to determine if a rule applies. 

Thus the new configuration supports the following:

``` properties
allowed.paths=["/content/geometrixx/en", "/content/geometrixx/de"]
static.template="/apps/geometrixx/templates/homepage"
sling.resourceType="geometrixx/components/homepage"
editable.template="/conf/geodemo/settings/wcm/templates/geodemo-home-page"
container.resourceType="geodemo/components/content/container"
remove.components=["newslist","image"]
rename.components=["par\=container/container","rightpar\=container_1659979946"]
order.components=["header","carousel","container","container_1659979946","container:lead"]
```

### "Like" Sling Resource Type Support

This update allows node-based rule configurations to use a "relative" path for matching. The patterns shown below will all match any component with the resource type `aem-modernize/components/text`:

```xml
<patterns jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
  <text jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
      sling:resourceType="aem-modernize/components/text"/>
</patterns>

<patterns jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
  <text jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
      sling:resourceType="components/text"/>
</patterns>

<patterns jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
  <text jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
      sling:resourceType="text"/>
</patterns>
```

Finding rules that may match is done by looking at the source resource type and checking rules against each sub-portion. Thus a resource type of `aem-modenrize/components/text`, will perform a lookup for rules that have a `sling:resourceType` pattern of:

  * aem-modernize/components/text
  * components/text
  * text

This means that [atterns should be very specific for other properties if the pattern's resource type is very generic. This is especially true for highly-used components such as `text`.

#### Reasoning

This was added as teams found that a single component was used across multiple tenants, but each tenant's rules were exactly the same. This required a rule to be defined as:

```xml
<patterns jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
  <text jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
      sling:resourceType="tenant-a/components/text"/>
  <text jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
        sling:resourceType="tenant-b/components/text"/>
  <text jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
        sling:resourceType="tenant-c/components/text"/>
</patterns>
```

But can now be defined as:

```xml
<patterns jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
  <text jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
      sling:resourceType="components/text"/>
</patterns>
```
