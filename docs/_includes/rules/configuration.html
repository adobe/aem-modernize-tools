## Overview

Rewrite rules are defined in two parts:

1. One or more *patterns*, used for determining which transformation rule should be applied (if any) to a given node.
1. A *replacement*, defining the rules for the transformation: How content should be coped and transformed to the replacement node.

``` xml
<title>
  <patterns jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
    <title jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
           sling:resourceType="geometrixx/components/title"/>
  </patterns>
  <replacement jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
    <title jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
           jcr:title="${'./jcr:title'}"
           linkURL="${'./href'}"
           sling:resourceType="geodemo/components/content/title"
           type="${'./type'}"/>
  </replacement>
</title>
```


## Ranking (Optional)

A rewrite rule may specify an optional `cq:rewriteRaking` property. This can be used to prioritize one rule over others,
when there may be multiple matches.

## Patterns

Each rewrite rule has a node containing a set of patterns. This 'wrapping' node must be named `patterns`, otherwise the rule will be ignored. Each child node of this parent are pattern rules against which nodes are matched for comparisons.


### Pattern

Pattern nodes are effectively a set of properties and optional node tree which must be matched to apply the replacement rules.
The name of each pattern node is arbitrary.

```xml
<patterns jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
  <title jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
         sling:resourceType="geometrixx/components/title"/>
</patterns>
```
Each property of the pattern must be matched exactly for this rule to be applied. This generally includes, at a minimum:

* The primary node type
* The `sling:resourceType` property's value.

Patterns may also specify any other arbitrary properties, child nodes, or entire trees, to be matched. The rules for matching are universal - every property and node of the source node must match the expected rule's entire hierarchy, property for property, node for node - with one allowed exception: Optional children.


#### Rewrite Optional

```xml
<patterns jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
  <lead jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
        sling:resourceType="geometrixx/components/lead">
    <items jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
           cq:rewriteOptional="true"/>
  </lead>
</patterns>
```

The pattern allows for optional child ancestors; by specifying the property `cq:rewriteOptional` to a node in the pattern, if that node does not exist in the repository, it will not fail the match rule. If the node does exist, the rule will apply the same full equivalency match requirements.


## Replacement

Regardless of how many patterns are specified, there is only one *replacement* definition. This node structure prescribes the new structure that will replace any found nodes.

```xml
<replacement jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
  <title jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
         jcr:title="${'./jcr:title'}"
         linkURL="${'./href'}"
         sling:resourceType="geodemo/components/content/title"
         type="${'./type'}"/>
</replacement>
```
A replacement definition may choose to specify no replacement structure. If this is the case, the original node will be removed, and no replacement or transformations made.

Replacement definitions contain one child node containing all of the replacement rules, any additional children beyond the first are ignored.

Any original content (property or child nodes) that are not referenced by the replacement definition are ignored, and will not be on the resulting replacement node.

### Static Values

Replacement definitions can contain any number of static properties to set. The existence or value of any like-named property on the original node is ignored.

Every replacement will contain static values for the `jcr:primaryType` and `sling:resourceType` properties.

### Copying Properties

Properties can be copied from the original node to its replacement. These definitions can also apply some simple transformative operations during the copy. For more advanced capabilities, see the [Rewriting Properties](#rewriting-properties) section.

```xml
<replacement jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
  <title jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
         jcr:title="${'./jcr:title'}"
         linkURL="${'./href'}"
         sling:resourceType="geodemo/components/content/title"
         type="${'./type'}"/>
</replacement>
```

Property copies are identified with the expression syntax `${ }`. The value within the expression identifies the property to find on the original node. These examples show the use of single quotes `'` to encapsulate the property name. This is necessary for any properties containing a colon `:`. However, we recommend their use on all expressions.

#### Simple Copy

```xml
<replacement jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
  <example
      jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
      prop="${'./some/prop'}"
      sling:resourceType="example/resource/type"/>
</replacement>
```
This example shows the simplest use case - copying a value from an original property. The original node will be searched for the property at `./some/prop`. If it is found, it will be set to the replacement node's `prop` property. If the the original property is not found, this replacement rule is ignored, and the property `prop` will not be set.

#### Boolean Negation

```xml
<replacement jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
  <example
      jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
      booleanValue="!${'./some/boolean/prop'}"
      sling:resourceType="example/resource/type"/>
</replacement>
```

Properties that are of type `boolean` can be negated during the copying operation.

#### Default Value

```xml
<replacement jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
  <example
      jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
      foo="${'./some/missing/prop':bar}"
      sling:resourceType="example/resource/type"/>
</replacement>
```

The default handling of a missing property is to ignore it during the transformation. However, if desired, a default value can be specified instead. In this example the property `foo` will be set to the value *bar*.


#### If/Else Option

```xml
<replacement jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
  <example
      jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
      foo="[${'./some/missing/prop'}, ${'./exists'}]"
      sling:resourceType="example/resource/type"/>
</replacement>
```
Another option for handling a missing property is to set the value a secondary option. This example shows that the property `foo` of the new node, will be set too the value of the original node's `./exists` property.

### Rewriting Properties

In some cases, a more robust transformation is needed for string properties. This can be achieved by specifying a rewrite property node.

```xml
<replacement jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
  <example
      jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
      foo="[${'./some/missing/prop'}, ${'./exists'}]"
      sling:resourceType="example/resource/type">
    <cq:rewriteProperties
        jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
        rewrite-remove-prefix="[(?:prefix-)(.+), $1]"
        rewrite-remove-suffix="[(.+)(?:-suffix), $1]"
        rewrite-concat-tokens="[(.+)(?:-separator-)(.+), $1$2]"
        rewrite-single-operand="[(?:prefix-)(.+)]"
        rewrite-boolean="[(.+), edited-$1]"
        foo="[(?:prefix-)(.+), $1]"
    />
  </example>
</replacement>
```

A replacement definition may contain a `cq:rewriteProperties` node, containing regular expression rules for transforming string properties of the original node.

Each property of the `cq:rewriteProperties` node must match property definition contained in the original replacement list,
otherwise it will be ignored.

Each property of this node will contain string array containing two values:
1. The regular expression used for matching the original value, including any grouping rules.
1. The replacement to apply to the string - grouping references from the regular expression are supported.

In the example shown, the `foo` property originally contains the string value: *prefix-removed*. This is copied to the new property, then the rewrite rules are applied, and the value is updated and finalized to the string: *removed*.

### Copying Children

```xml
<replacement jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
  <lead jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
        jcr:description="${'./jcr:description'}"
        jcr:title="${'./jcr:title'}"
        sling:resourceType="geodemo/components/content/lead"
        cq:copyChildren="{Boolean}true"
  />
</replacement>
```

Some source nodes are not single items, they may be a tree of content that needs to be coped to the destination. Setting the the `cq:copyChildren` property of the replacement node to **true** to perform this operation. The children of the matched source node are copied to the destination, order and names preserved.

### Renaming and Reordering Children

```xml
<replacement jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
  <lead jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
        jcr:description="${'./jcr:description'}"
        jcr:title="${'./jcr:title'}"
        sling:resourceType="geodemo/components/content/lead"
        cq:copyChildren="{Boolean}true" >

    <items jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
           cq:rewriteMapChildren="./notItems"
           cq:orderBefore="nextNode" />
  </lead>
</replacement>
```
In the event that the child nodes need to be renamed or reordered, additional rules are necessary. Similar to the property rewrite, a node definition is used to configure the transformation process.

The name of the node should be the desired new name on the replacement tree. This will contain the rules for the conversion.
The `cq:rewriteMapChildren` property is used to specify which original node should be renamed. Order is managed by setting the `cq:orderBefore` property to the node which should be *next* in the order.

### Final Node Definition

```xml
<replacement
    jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
    cq:rewriteFinal="{Boolean}true" >

  <lead jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
        jcr:description="${'./jcr:description'}"
        jcr:title="${'./jcr:title'}"
        sling:resourceType="geodemo/components/content/lead"
        cq:copyChildren="{Boolean}true" >

    <items jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
           cq:rewriteMapChildren="./notItems"
           cq:orderBefore="nextNode" />
  </lead>
</replacement>
```

A replacement node or it's children may specify an optional `cq:rewriteFinal` property. This is used to flag that the associated tree of content is a final transformation, and need not be scanned again.

    </patterns>
  </aggregate>
  <replacement jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
    <text
        jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
        sling:resourceType="geodemo/components/content/teaser"
        jcr:title="${'./[pattern:titlePattern]/jcr:title'}"
        jcr:description="${./[pattern:textPattern]/text}"
        textIsRich="${./[pattern:textPattern]/text}"
        fileReference="${'./[pattern:imagePattern]/fileReference'}"
    />
  </replacement>
</teaser>
```

Aggregation rules allow teams to specify a sequence of patters that must be matched explicitly, and that will be replaced with a single output node. Component consolidation is used to reduce the number of custom components, or update a set reference to use Core Components. In the example above, the rule will convert the pattern of an image, title, and text node set, into a single _Teaser_ Core Component proxy.

Since the names of the nodes are unknown during the conversion process, the `[pattern:????]` reference is used to determine from which node a given property should be copied. Thus:

```
jcr:description="${./[pattern:textPattern]/text}"
```

Will set the `jcr:description` property to the value found in the `text` property, of whichever node matched that pattern rule. All the [rewrite rules](#rewriting-properties) are a available in the replacement definition.
