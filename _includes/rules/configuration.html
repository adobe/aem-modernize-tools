## Overview

Rewrite rules are defined in two parts:

1. One or more *patterns*, used for determining which transformation rule should be applied (if any) to a given node.
1. A *replacement*, defining the rules for the transformation: How content should be coped and transformed to the replacement node.

```xml
<title>
  <patterns jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
    <title jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
           sling:resourceType="geometrixx/components/title"/>
  </patterns>
  <replacement jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured">
    <title jcr:primaryType="nt:unstructured"
           jcr:title="${'./jcr:title'}"
           linkURL="${'./href'}"
           sling:resourceType="geodemo/components/content/title"
           type="${'./type'}"/>
  </replacement>
</title>
```


## Ranking (Optional)

A rewrite rule may specify an optional `cq:rewriteRaking` property. This can be used to prioritize one rule over others,
when there may be multiple matches

The primary use case for this is for overriding the out-of-the-box dialog widget conversions rules.This suite contains
rules for most of the AEM Provided Classic and Coral2 widgets, to their Coral3 counterparts. This ranking allows
customer implementations to override provided rules with one with a higher ranking.

## Patterns

Each rewrite rule has a node containing a set of patterns. This 'wrapping' node must be named `patterns`, otherwise the
rule will be ignored. Each child node of this parent are pattern rules against which nodes are matched for comparisons.


### Pattern

Pattern nodes are effectively a set of properties and optional node tree which must be matched to apply the replacement rules.
The name of each pattern node is arbitrary.

<p class="image">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/configuration/images/node-pattern-definition.png" alt="Node Pattern Definition" />
</p>

Each property of the pattern must be matched exactly for this rule to be applied. Minimally this generally includes:

* The primary node type
* The `sling:resourceType` property's value.

Patterns may also specify any other arbitrary properties, child nodes, or entire trees, to be matched. The rules for
matching are universal - every property and node of the source node must match the expected rule's entire hierarchy,
property for property, node for node - with one allowed exception: Optional children.


#### Rewrite Optional

<p class="image">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/configuration/images/node-pattern-tree-definition.png" alt="Node Pattern Tree Definition" />
</p>

The pattern allows for optional child ancestors; by specifying the property `cq:rewriteOptional` to a node in the
pattern, if that node does not exist in the repository, it will not fail the match rule. If the node does exist, the
rule will apply the same full equivalency match requirements.


## Replacement

Regardless of how many patterns are specified, there is only one *replacement* definition. This node structure prescribes
the new structure that will replace any found nodes.

<p class="image">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/configuration/images/node-replacement-definition.png" alt="Node Replacement Definition"/>
</p>

A replacement definition may choose to specify no replacement structure. If this is the case, the original node will be
removed, and no replacement or transformations made.

Replacement definitions contain one child node containing all of the replacement rules, any additional children beyond
the first are ignored.

Any content (property or child nodes) that are not referenced by the replacement definition are ignored, and will not be on
the resulting replacement node.

### Static Values

Replacement definitions can contain any number of static properties to set. The existence or value of any like-named
property on the original node is ignored.

Every replacement will contain static values for the `jcr:primaryType` and `sling:resourceType` properties.

### Copying Properties

Properties can be copied from the original node to its replacement. These definitions can also apply some simple transformative
operations during the copy. For more advanced capabilities, see the [Rewriting Properties](#rewriting-properties) section.

<p class="image">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/configuration/images/node-replacement-definition.png" alt="Replacement Node Definition"/>
</p>

Property copies are identified with the expression syntax `${ }`. The value within the expression identifies the property
to find on the original node. These examples show the use of single quotes `'` to encapsulate the property name. This is
necessary for any properties containing a colon `:`. However, we recommend their use on all expressions.

#### Simple Copy

<p class="image">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/configuration/images/node-simple-copy-definition.png" alt="Simple Copy Replacement Definition"/>
</p>

This example shows the simplest use case - copying a value from an original property. The original node will be searched for
the property at `./some/prop`. If it is found, it will be set to the replacement node's `prop` property. If the the original
property is not found, this replacement rule is ignored, and the property `prop` will not be set.

#### Boolean Negation

<p class="image">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/configuration/images/node-boolean-negation-definition.png" alt="Boolean Negation Definition"/>
</p>

Properties that are of type `boolean` can be negated during the copying operation.

#### Default Value

<p class="image">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/configuration/images/node-default-definition.png" alt="Default Replacement Definition"/>
</p>

The default handling of a missing property is to ignore it during the transformation. However, if desired, a default value
can be specified instead. In this example the property `foo` will be set to the value *bar*.


#### If/Else Option

<p class="image">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/configuration/images/node-ifelse-definition.png" alt="If/Else Replacement Definition"/>
</p>

Another option for handling a missing property is to set the value a secondary option. This example shows that the property
`foo` of the new node, will be set too the value of the original node's `./exists` property.

### Rewriting Properties

In some cases, a more robust transformation is needed for string properties. This can be achieved by specifying a rewrite
property node.

<p class="image">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/configuration/images/node-rewrite-properties-definition.png" alt="Rewrite Properties Definition"/>
</p>

A replacement definition may contain a `cq:rewriteProperties` node, containing regular expression rules for transforming
string properties of the original node.

Each property of the `cq:rewriteProperties` node must match property definition contained in the original replacement list,
otherwise it will be ignored.

Each property of this node will contain string array containing two values:
1. The regular expression used for matching the original value, including any grouping rules.
1. The replacement to apply to the string - grouping references from the regular expression are supported.

In the example shown, the `foo` property originally contains the string value: *prefix-removed*. This is copied to the
new property, then the rewrite rules are applied, and the value is updated and finalized to the string: *removed*.

### Copying Children

<p class="image">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/configuration/images/node-copy-children-definition.png" alt="Copy Children Replacement Definition"/>
</p>

Some source nodes are not single items, they may be a tree of content that needs to be coped to the destination. Setting
the the `cq:copyChildren` property of the replacement node to **true** to perform this operation. The children of the
matched source node are copied to the destination, order and names preserved.

### Renaming and Reordering Children

<p class="image">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/configuration/images/node-map-children-definition.png" alt="Map Children Replacement Definition"/>
</p>

In the event that the child nodes need to be renamed or reordered, additional rules are necessary. Similar to the property
rewrite, a node definition is used to configure the transformation process.

The name of the node should be the desired new name on the replacement tree. This will contain the rules for the conversion.
The `cq:rewriteMapChildren` property is used to specify which original node should be renamed. Order is managed by setting
the `cq:orderBefore` property to the node which should be *next* in the order.

### Final Node Definition

<p class="image">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/configuration/images/node-final-definition.png" alt="Final Rule Definition"/>
</p>

A replacement node or it's children may specify an optional `cq:rewriteFinal` property. This is used to flag that the
associated tree of content is a final transformation, and need not be scanned again.

This is primarily useful and used by the Dialog Conversion - as it traverses the `dialog` node tree, each descendant has
a distinct rewrite rule to be applied. It intent is to optimize the traversal - so if unsure, omit it.
